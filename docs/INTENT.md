# Architectural Intent

## Overview
The repository aims to provide a maintainable, modular platform for personal portfolio management.

## Architecture
The design embraces principles of hexagonal architecture. Domain logic is separated from infrastructure concerns such as data providers, database access and caching. By using Nx, the workspace enforces clear boundaries between applications and libraries.

## Components
- **Domain services** reside in backend modules and are exposed through REST endpoints.
- **Infrastructure adapters** include Prisma for database access, Bull for background processing and Redis for caching.
- **Presentation** is handled by the Angular client and the NestJS controllers.

## Dependencies
Only the `common` and `ui` libraries are shared among applications, limiting coupling and encouraging a layered structure.

## Patterns
Dependency injection, modular Nx projects and the use of enumerations for domain states emphasize maintainability.
