# Architectural Intent

## Overview
Ghostfolio follows a modular monorepo approach that combines an Angular front‑end with a NestJS back‑end. The design aims for a clear separation of concerns between API, client and shared libraries. Build tooling provided by Nx coordinates tasks and enforces consistent patterns across projects.

## Architecture
The solution leans toward a hexagonal architecture. External services (market data providers, Stripe) are abstracted behind interfaces in the API layer. Business logic resides in services and modules, while infrastructure concerns (database, queues) are kept separate through Prisma and Bull integrations.

## Components
- **Data Provider Services** encapsulate external API calls.
- **Cron and Queue Modules** handle background jobs.
- **Client** consumes the REST API and uses UI components from `libs/ui`.

## Patterns
- Inversion of control via NestJS dependency injection.
- Modular boundaries defined by Nx libraries.
- Use of typed models and DTOs to separate layers.
